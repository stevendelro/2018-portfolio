            Before you think Iâ€™m an incredible front-end designer, scroll down
            and check out the footer. I always give credit where credit is due.
            Having said that, I want you to leave this page with a better
            understanding of who I am.

            <br />
            Endlessly curious and easily entertained, my appetite to learn and
            understand enriches my life on a daily basis. I feed my mind with
            books and podcasts. I meditate through running and hiking. I make
            connections. I write.
            <br />
            <br />I spent six months learning and looking for the perfect dog,
            and now I have the best dog a man could ever have. I've spent years
            searching for the right woman to become my lovely girlfriend. Having
            found her, I couldn't be happier. I've spent a decade searching for
            a career that would challenge my intellect, improve my personal
            agency and keep me relevent within this ever-changing digital world.
            <br />
            <br />
            Becoming a javascript developer has given me exactly that.
            <br />

            Be sure to check out the blog for more insight on who I am and how I
            think. I'm always on the lookout for good book recommendations, so
            definitely reach out if you have any in mind.
