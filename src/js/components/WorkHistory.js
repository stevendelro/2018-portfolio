            Veterinary Technician/ Veterinary Assistant
          </h3>
          <p>
            Snug Pet Resort was a place were I was able to really hone in on my
            social strengths. Here, I was able to develop and refine my
            empathetic approach to leadership. Aside from training dogs, I was
            able to master every position available. I became extremely
            proficient with Cornerstone, Avimark and Kennel Connection software.
            I developed great professional relationships with all the clientele.
            I spent my last year with them as a vet technician, assisting the
            veterinarians with all procedures and protocols.

          <p>
            Although Iâ€™ve been working since I was 15, Fresh & Easy was the
            first job where I proved to myself that I have what it takes to be a
            leader. As an entry level employee, I worked my way up to to shift
            manager. Here, I developed my work ethic, my sense of urgency, time
            management, the ability to take ownership of my mistakes, and how to
            cultivate a rich social landscape with all my coworkers.
