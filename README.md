## About The Project

#### What motivated me to make this?

This portfolio was developed back in 2018. I had just finished my coding bootcamp and needed to create a portfolio to help me out with my job search.

I was given the direction that I shouldn't spend too much time working on it, as creating a portfolio for most bootcamp students can tend to become a huge time consumer. The main point was to display the projects that you've created.

With this in mind, I began looking for some kind of template that I could use in order to quickly throw something together. Every template that I found and attempted to implement needed its CSS modified for it to satisfy my needs. This led me down the path of trying to get a better grasp of CSS.

I ended up taking a Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann called: Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More. The course was entirely written with HTML5 and CSS3, with absolutely zero Javascript.

I completed the entire course, which exposed me to a ton of web design modalities like BEM architecture and Sass related concepts including nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, etc. Also, learning to understand media queries was really eye-opening for me. For some reason, I developed a huge affinity for responsive design.

After the course, I decided that instead of using the skills that I just learned to slightly modify some existing template, why not convert the entire HTML/CSS codebase into a React project? This felt like a better idea than using some wordpress template. At least this way, I would intimately know and understand the entire code base.

#### What points about this project would I like to highlight?

I've completed all unfinished features and have heavily modified and altered large sections of the original project code to learn, experiement, and ultimately produce what you now see before you.

The images, video/gifs and colors that are used on this site were all selected and edited by me.

All extra functionality was developed by me with the techniques learned from the course. In no way, shape, or form do I take any personal credit for this website's initial design, but I did totally refine and polish it like a boss.
