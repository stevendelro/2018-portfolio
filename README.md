# 2018 Portfolio

### [SITE IS LIVE!](https://www.stevendelrosario.com)

#### Completed 

1. Rework Main.js into seperate components.
2. Fix all image related issues.
3. Integrate SendGrid to get the Contact Form working properly.
4. Replace React with Preact.
5. ~Code-split all the things OR server-side render, depending on which is less abrasive to implement.~
After implementing preact, my main bundle is roughly 190KiB, so no need to implement any more complexity.
6. Get site back online on Digital Ocean.
7. Contact form is now running correctly.

#### Problems to fix:

* Hunt for errors in styling across all device screen widths.

#### Agenda for next week ( Mon 11/5 - Fri 11/9)

* Complete the project blog posts and route the correct url to the blog post button in my project popups.
* Make and route a proper "thank you" page when an email is sent from the contact form.

Other than that, this thing is finally DONE. The job hunt begins next week.

Time to enjoy the weekend and get some rest in order to hit it hard on Monday.
