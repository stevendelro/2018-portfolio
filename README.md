### [SITE IS LIVE!](https://www.stevendelrosario.com)

#### Completed 

1. Rework Main.js into seperate components.
2. Fix all image related issues.
3. Integrate SendGrid to get the Contact Form working properly.
4. Replace React with Preact.
5. ~Code-split all the things OR server-side render, depending on which is less abrasive to implement.~
After implementing preact, my main bundle is roughly 190KiB, so no need to implement any more complexity.
6. Get site back online on Digital Ocean.
7. Contact form is now running correctly.
8. Make and route a proper "thank you" page when an email is sent from the contact form.
9. Wire up routing to "thank you" page after email submission.

#### Problems to fix:

* Prevent company name text from showing onHover when viewed from small screens.

#### Agenda for next week ( Mon 11/5 - Fri 11/9)

* Complete the project blog posts and route the correct url to the blog post button in my project popups.
