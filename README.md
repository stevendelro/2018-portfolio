# 2018 Portfolio

### [SITE IS LIVE!](https://www.stevendelrosario.com)

#### Completed 

1. Rework Main.js into seperate components.
2. Fix all image related issues.
3. Integrate SendGrid to get the Contact Form working properly.
4. Replace React with Preact.
5. ~Code-split all the things OR server-side render, depending on which is less abrasive to implement.~
After implementing preact, my main bundle is roughly 190KiB, so no need to implement any more complexity.
6. Get site back online on Digital Ocean.

#### Problems to fix:

* Contact form works correctly when hosted from my local machine, but for some reason it doesn't work at all when live on the server. 
* Favicon up in the browser tab isn't loading.

#### Agenda for next week ( Mon 11/5 - Fri 11/9)
* Fix the above problems
* Revive an old blog to host the blog posts.
* Complete the project blog posts.

At this point in time, this portfolio is good enough to begin applying for jobs. 

Time to enjoy the weekend and get some rest in order to hit it hard next week!
