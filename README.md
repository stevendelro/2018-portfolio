# 2018 Portfolio

### [SITE IS LIVE!](https://www.stevendelrosario.com)

#### Completed 

1. Rework Main.js into seperate components.
2. Fix all image related issues.
3. Integrate SendGrid to get the Contact Form working properly.
4. Replace React with Preact.
5. ~Code-split all the things OR server-side render, depending on which is less abrasive to implement.~
After implementing preact, my main bundle is roughly 190KiB, so no need to implement any more complexity.
6. Get site back online on Digital Ocean.

#### Problems to fix:

* Contact form isn't working correctly because it never receives a resolved response. I don't believe I have the correct MX records set up.

#### Agenda for next week ( Mon 11/5 - Fri 11/9)

* Figure out the MX records and get SendGrid working correctly.
* Revive an old blog to host the project blog posts.
* Complete the project blog posts and route the correct url to the blog post button in my project popups.

Other than those things, at this point in time my portfolio is good enough to begin applying for jobs. 

Time to enjoy the weekend and get some rest in order to hit it hard next week!
