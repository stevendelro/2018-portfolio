# 2018 Portfolio

A full write up of thoughts and anectdotes regarding the creation of this portfolio will be created once I have it properly hosted.

#### Completed 

1. Rework Main.js into seperate components.
2. Fix all image related issues.
3. Integrate SendGrid to get the Contact Form working properly.
4. Replace React with Preact.
5. ~Code-split all the things OR server-side render, depending on which is less abrasive to implement.~
- After implementing preact, my main bundle is roughly 190KiB, so no need to implement any more complexity.

#### Agenda 

* Get all images and projects hosted on Digital Ocean.
* Get site back online on Digital Ocean.
* Complete the project blog posts.
* Revive an old blog to host the blog posts.
